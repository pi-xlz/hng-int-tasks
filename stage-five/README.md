# Stage Five

My project is unfortunately far from being finished.
There is a lot to be desired, functionality wise.



## Features yet to be added

- Fully functional screen recording.
- Backend API implementation(HelpMeOut web app)
- Clean up task 2(visually and minor bug fixes)
- Proper documentation for both tasks.
- Proper routing of all pages of the HelpMeOut web app( You can temporary access all pages by appending to the url. See gif below).
